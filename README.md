# 🧠 My Java Coding Practice Archive  

*— A living log of problems solved, patterns learned, and progress made*

This repository isn’t just a folder of code—it’s **my digital notebook** for mastering data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving in **Java**. Every file here represents a moment of focus, a bug I wrestled with, or a concept that finally clicked.

I started this not to impress anyone, but to **build consistency**. In a world full of tutorials and shortcuts, I wanted a space where I could *do the work*, day after day, without distraction.


## 🗂️ How It’s Organized

I’ve grouped problems by the **platform or curriculum** that inspired them:

- **`takeuforward/`**  
  Following [Striver’s SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) — a goldmine for DSA interview prep. Organized by topic: arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, DP, etc.

- **`leetcode/`**  
  Classic LeetCode problems, named with their number and title (e.g., `0001-two-sum/`). I solve these to sharpen my logic and prepare for real interview scenarios.

- **`neetcode/`**  
  Based on the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/) list — a curated set of the most important problems. Grouped by NeetCode’s own categories like “Arrays & Hashing” or “Backtracking”.

- **`hackerrank/`**  
  Mostly from HackerRank’s *Algorithms* and *Data Structures* tracks. Great for foundational practice and timed challenges.

Inside each, you’ll find:
```
platform/
└── topic/
    └── problem-name/
        └── Solution.java
```

Every `Solution.java` is **self-contained**, includes comments explaining my approach, and often has a `main()` method with sample test cases so I can run it instantly.



## ☕ Why Java?

I chose Java because:
- It’s what I use daily (or aim to).
- Its strong typing helps me think clearly about data.
- It’s widely used in enterprise and interviews.
- Writing clean, object-oriented Java forces discipline.

No Python shortcuts here—just deliberate practice in the language I want to master.



## 📈 What This Repo Tracks (For Me)

This isn’t about solving 1000 problems. It’s about **deep understanding**. For each problem, I ask:
- What’s the brute force?  
- Can I optimize time or space?  
- Have I seen this pattern before?  
- How would I explain this in an interview?

Over time, I hope to see:
- Fewer “I’ve seen this before!” moments → more “I can derive this!” moments  
- Cleaner code with less boilerplate  
- Faster recognition of problem types (sliding window, DFS vs BFS, DP states, etc.)


## 🛠️ How I Use It

1. **Daily Practice**: Pick 1–2 problems based on my current focus area.  
2. **Review Weekly**: Revisit old solutions—can I improve them?  
3. **Run Locally**:  
   ```bash
   cd leetcode/0020-valid-parentheses/
   javac Solution.java && java Solution
   ```
4. **Commit with Context**:  
   My commit messages often include notes like:  
   _“Solved using stack — remembered the pattern from NeetCode!”_



## 🌱 This Is a Work in Progress

Some solutions are elegant. Others are… functional.  
Some folders are full. Others are empty—waiting for me to show up tomorrow.
>And that’s okay.  
This repo isn’t perfect.  
**It’s alive.**

As long as I’m learning, it’s serving its purpose.
