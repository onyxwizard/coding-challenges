# 🌟 Pattern Printing – Logic & Problem-Solving Guide (Patterns 1 to 20)

This guide explains the **core logic and thought process** behind solving 10 fundamental star and number pattern problems — commonly seen in coding interviews and beginner programming exercises (e.g., from *takeUforward*). The focus is on **how to think**, not on code syntax.

---
## 🔷 **General Approach to Pattern Problems**

1. **Observe the pattern visually**:
   - How many rows?
   - How many columns per row?
   - What changes per row? (stars, numbers, spaces)
   - Is it symmetric? Inverted? Centered?

2. **Break it into parts**:
   - Top half / bottom half
   - Leading spaces / content / trailing spaces
   - Increasing vs decreasing sequences

3. **Relate row number (`i`) to output**:
   - Stars in row `i` = `i`, `2*i - 1`, `n - i + 1`, etc.
   - Spaces before content = `n - i`, `i - 1`, etc.

4. **Handle spaces carefully**:
   - For centered patterns: leading spaces shrink as stars grow.
   - For left-aligned: often no leading spaces.
   - For right-aligned: leading spaces = `n - current_stars`.

## 🔹 **Pattern 1: Square of Stars**
- **Goal**: Print an `N x N` grid of stars.
- **Thinking**:
  - Every row has **exactly N stars**.
  - No variation across rows → **two nested loops**, both from `1` to `N`.
  - **No spaces between stars** (as per example output).

> 💡 Key insight: Uniformity — same content in every row.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 2: Right-Angled Triangle (Stars)**
- **Goal**: Row `i` has `i` stars.
- **Thinking**:
  - Outer loop: `i = 1 to N` (rows).
  - Inner loop: `j = 1 to i` (print star for each column up to current row number).
  - **Space between stars is allowed** (as shown in example).

> 💡 Key insight: Inner loop bound depends on outer loop index.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 3: Number Triangle (1 to i)**
- **Goal**: Row `i` prints numbers `1, 2, ..., i`.
- **Thinking**:
  - Same structure as Pattern 2.
  - Instead of printing `"*"`, print the **column number `j`**.
  - Numbers increase left to right in each row.

> 💡 Key insight: Content = loop variable of inner loop.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 4: Repeated Row Number**
- **Goal**: Row `i` prints the number `i`, repeated `i` times.
- **Thinking**:
  - Outer loop: `i = 1 to N`.
  - Inner loop: print `i` (not `j`) for `i` times.
  - Content depends on **outer loop variable**.

> 💡 Key insight: What you print ≠ loop counter of inner loop.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 5: Inverted Right Pyramid (Stars)**
- **Goal**: Row 1 has `N` stars, row 2 has `N-1`, ..., last row has 1.
- **Thinking**:
  - Outer loop: `i = 0 to N-1` OR `i = N down to 1`.
  - Inner loop: print stars from `1` to `N - i` (if increasing `i`) OR `1` to `i` (if decreasing `i`).
  - Reverse of Pattern 2.

> 💡 Key insight: Decreasing sequence → reverse the row logic.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 6: Inverted Number Pyramid (1 to i)**
- **Goal**: Row 1: `1 2 ... N`, Row 2: `1 2 ... N-1`, etc.
- **Thinking**:
  - Outer loop: `i = N down to 1`.
  - Inner loop: `j = 1 to i`, print `j`.
  - Same as Pattern 3, but **rows decrease**.

> 💡 Key insight: Same content logic as Pattern 3, but iterate rows backward.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 7: Centered Star Pyramid**
- **Goal**: Symmetric pyramid with odd stars: 1, 3, 5, ..., `2N-1`.
- **Thinking**:
  - **Leading spaces**: decrease as row increases → `N - i` spaces.
  - **Stars per row**: always odd → `2*i - 1`.
  - **No spaces between stars** (as per example image).
  - Total width of base = `2N - 1` characters.

> 💡 Key insight: Centering = leading spaces + odd-numbered stars.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 8: Inverted Centered Star Pyramid**
- **Goal**: Upside-down version of Pattern 7.
- **Thinking**:
  - **Leading spaces**: increase as row goes down → `N - i` (but `i` decreases).
  - **Stars per row**: `2*i - 1`, with `i` going from `N` down to `1`.
  - Mirror of Pattern 7.

> 💡 Key insight: Reverse the row order of Pattern 7; space and star logic adapt naturally.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 9: Full Diamond**
- **Goal**: Pyramid + inverted pyramid (without duplicating middle).
- **Thinking**:
  - **Top half**: same as Pattern 7 (`i = 1 to N`).
  - **Bottom half**: same as Pattern 8, but **start from `N-1`** (not `N`) to avoid duplicate middle row.
  - Total rows = `2N - 1`.

> ⚠️ Common mistake: Printing middle row twice by starting bottom at `N`.

> 💡 Key insight: Diamond = Pyramid + Inverted Pyramid (excluding middle in second part).

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 10: Half Diamond (Fixed Left Margin)**
- **Goal**: Vertical "hourglass" but **left-aligned with fixed indentation**.
- **Visual**:
  ```
     *
     **
     ***
     **
     *
  ```
- **Thinking**:
  - **Not centered!** All rows have **same leading spaces** (`N-1` spaces).
  - **Top**: row `i` has `i` stars.
  - **Bottom**: row `i` has `i` stars, for `i = N-1 down to 1`.
  - **No spacing between stars** (as per example).

> ❌ Common mistake: Confusing this with a **centered diamond** (Pattern 9).  
> ✅ Remember: **Fixed left padding**, not dynamic centering.

> 💡 Key insight: Leading spaces are **constant**, not dependent on row content.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 11: Binary Number Triangle**
- **Goal**: Each row alternates `0` and `1`, starting with `1` on odd rows.
- **Thinking**:
  - Row 1 starts with `1`, Row 2 with `0`, Row 3 with `1`, etc.
  - Within a row, toggle between `0` and `1`.
  - Starting value = `1` if row is odd, `0` if even → `start = (i % 2 == 1) ? 1 : 0`.
  - Then flip after each print.

> 💡 Key insight: **Row parity determines starting bit**; inner loop toggles.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 12: Number Crown**
- **Goal**: Left: `1..i`, Right: `i..1`, with spaces in between.
- **Thinking**:
  - Left part: print `1` to `i`.
  - Right part: print `i` down to `1`.
  - Middle gap: decreases as row increases → `(n - i)` units of **double space** (to match width of two digits).
  - Total structure: `[left][gap][right]`.

> 💡 Key insight: **Mirror numbers** with a shrinking gap.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 13: Increasing Number Triangle**
- **Goal**: Fill triangle with consecutive numbers row-wise.
- **Thinking**:
  - Use a **global counter** (e.g., `num = 1`).
  - For each row, print `i` numbers, incrementing the counter each time.
  - No reset per row — numbers flow continuously.

> 💡 Key insight: **Stateful counter** across rows.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 14: Increasing Letter Triangle**
- **Goal**: Row `i` prints first `i` uppercase letters: `A`, `A B`, `A B C`, ...
- **Thinking**:
  - Inner loop index `j` (0-based) maps to letter: `'A' + j`.
  - Print `j = 0` to `i-1` → letters `A` to `(A + i - 1)`.

> 💡 Key insight: **Loop index → letter** via ASCII.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 15: Reverse Letter Triangle**
- **Goal**: Start with full alphabet row, then shrink: `A B C D ...`, `A B C ...`, etc.
- **Thinking**:
  - Outer loop: `i = n` down to `1`.
  - Inner loop: print first `i` letters (`j = 0` to `i-1`).
  - Same as Pattern 14, but **reverse row order**.

> 💡 Key insight: **Decreasing row length**, same letter logic.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 16: Alpha-Ramp (Repeated Row Letter)**
- **Goal**: Row `i` prints the i-th letter repeated `i` times: `A`, `B B`, `C C C`, ...
- **Thinking**:
  - Outer loop index `i` (0-based) → letter = `'A' + i`.
  - Inner loop: print that letter `i+1` times.
  - Content depends on **outer loop**, not inner.

> 💡 Key insight: **Row index → letter**, repeated per row length.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 17: Alpha Hill (Palindromic Letter Pyramid)**
- **Goal**: Centered pyramid with palindromic letters: `A`, `ABA`, `ABCBA`, ...
- **Thinking**:
  - **Leading spaces**: decrease with row → `n - i - 1` (for 0-based `i`).
  - **Left half**: `A` to current letter (`'A' + i`).
  - **Right half**: reverse of left (excluding peak) → `('A' + i - 1)` down to `A`.
  - Total stars per row: `2*i + 1` letters.

> ⚠️ Common pitfall: **Off-by-one in spaces** — base width = `2n - 1`, so top row needs `(2n - 2)/2 = n - 1` spaces.

> 💡 Key insight: **Palindromic sequence + centering**.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 18: Alpha-Triangle (Reverse Start)**
- **Goal**: Row 1: last letter, Row 2: second-last + last, ..., last row: full sequence.
- **Thinking**:
  - Start from letter `'A' + n - 1` (e.g., `'F'` for n=6).
  - Row `k` (1-based): print letters from `('A' + n - k)` to `('A' + n - 1)`.
  - Outer loop: `i = n-1` down to `0`; inner: `j = i` to `n-1`.

> 💡 Key insight: **Fixed end, shrinking start**.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 19: Symmetric Void (Hollow Frame Diamond)**
- **Goal**: Outer stars, inner spaces, symmetric top and bottom.
- **Thinking**:
  - **Top half**: 
    - Left stars: `i` (decreasing from `n` to `1`)
    - Middle: `2*(n - i)` spaces (as `"  "` per unit)
    - Right stars: `i`
  - **Bottom half**: mirror of top (increasing stars).
  - Total rows: `2n`.

> 💡 Key insight: **Two solid blocks with expanding void**.

---
## 🔹 **Pattern 20: Symmetric Butterfly**
- **Goal**: Stars on sides, space in middle, forming butterfly wings.
- **Thinking**:
  - **Top half**:
    - Left stars: `i` (increasing)
    - Middle: `2*(n - i)` spaces
    - Right stars: `i`
  - **Bottom half**: mirror (decreasing `i` from `n-1`).
  - At middle row (`i = n`), no space → solid line.

> 💡 Key insight: **Wings grow inward**, space shrinks to zero at center.
